This is my second Touhou project, I've chosen LibGdx as a  library and took the screen system from the tyrian tutorial by Gustavo Steigert.
you can find the tyrian source here: http://steigert-libgdx-.googlecode.com
the tutorial is found here: http://steigert.blogsport.com
Most of the sprites are from http://spriters-resource.com and will be credited in the 'credits' file.
